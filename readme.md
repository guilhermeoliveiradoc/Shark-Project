# Sharks location and global warming

##Introduction

The idea of this project was to investigate if the data confirmed some theories about the new patterns of shark attacks, and it's relation with global warming. Two places were used to make this analysis: Florida and New South Wales.

Besides this investigation, another goal was to import data from excel, clean it, and investigate if they matched with the theories read previously.

##Seting up the problem

Annualy the blacktip sharks migrate from North Carolina to southern Florida during the coldest months. Acording to the biologist Stephen Kajiura, this pattern has been disturbed by the unusual heat of the season, that desistimulates the male sharks to change their locality.

Something similar happens to the cenario in New South Wales: the number of attacks increased dramatically in the last 10 years, and fattal atacks are becoming more common.

According to the newspaper The Guardian, the scientists also consider that the idiosyncrasies of ocean upwellings, currents and fish distribution, are affecting the way this predator is moving - after all, they usually go after their prey. This may be a reason to the increasing overlapping with humans.
